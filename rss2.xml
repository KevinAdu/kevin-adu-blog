      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since I’ve written a post. There’s been a lot of distractions, ups and down (especially downs) recently, so I decided to write a post that would motivate me and let anyone reading know that I aiming to achieve.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Ever since I’ve went back to the UK in January, I’ve noticed that my Japanese level has dropped considerably. I don’t feel as comfortable speaking or reading Japanese compared to December last year. There are lots of reasons, the main one being I lost the motivation to study and falling into the comfort zone of speaking English. Since it’s such a waste to let my efforts just degrade like this, I decided to jump back in and start studying again and achieve my goal of being fluent in this language.</p>
<p>It can be tough when you have work and generally have other things to do but I remembered an <a href="http://www.appleseeds.org/big-rocks_covey.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">analogy</a> I once saw when I started learning Japanese. It was referring to time and how we always have some spare time achieve our goals. I remember in my first year of living in Japan, I would spend the time commuting in crowded trains going through example sentences to understand grammar points. The 5 minute walk to the office to get some new Japanese vocabulary out of the way or even the 30 seconds sitting in the toilet to go over a point I learned in the morning. The biggest difference between the Kevin back then and now is that I was desperate to learn Japanese. In order to become like that again, I given myself some goals.</p>
<p>Japanese isn’t the only thing I want to improve in right now. I’m currently trying to learn web design and photography whilst trying to strengthen my web programming skills. So I’ve decided on three goals to help me improve all these skills. Firstly, I will take the Japanese Language Proficiency N2 exam this year. I took it last year but ended up failing. Secondly, I will release my portfolio site by the end of this year. Lastly, I will release another site which uses what I have learnt about photography.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve declared my goals to anyone who has read this post I have no choice but to achieve them. Once again, I feel desperate to achieve my goals.</p>

        &lt;p&gt;On my second week, there was something special that a lot of tourists and even the Japanese come all the way to take pictures of and that was the train that I always using to get to work. This train is know as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.co.jp/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=ja&amp;amp;u=https://www.enoden.co.jp/&amp;amp;prev=search&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Enoden&lt;/a&gt; or as the Enoshima Electric Railway. So I decided to follow suit and grab a picture myself. I think it’s a pretty good picture if I say so myself. Without further ado, here is my shot of the Enoden:&lt;/p&gt;

This train is know as the <a href="https://translate.google.co.jp/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=https://www.enoden.co.jp/&amp;prev=search" target="_blank" rel="external">Enoden</a> or as the Enoshima Electric Railway. So I decided to follow suit and grab a picture myself. I think it’s a pretty good picture if I say so myself. Without further ado, here is my shot of the Enoden:</p>

<img src="/en/Photo-of-the-Week-2-Enoden/enoden.jpg" alt="The Enoden train just departing from Kamakura-koukoumae station" title="The Enoden train just departing from Kamakura-koukoumae station">
<p>As I said, the Enoden is quite a popular train where from 2008 has carried around 15 million people despite it only have 2 - 3 carriages and coming every 12 minutes. It first started running from 1st September 1902 and the track is only 10km long with 15 stations. I believe what makes this train so special is the scenery that can be seen. You can see various types of landscapes from beaches to mountains to very traditional residential areas all within a span of around 30 minutes of riding the train. It connects <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g1021277-Activities-Fujisawa_Kanagawa_Prefecture_Kanto.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Fujisawa City</a> which is know for the infamous Enoshima island as I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.kevinadu.com/en/Photo-of-the-Week-1-Kugenuma/">previous article</a> to <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2166.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Kamakura</a> where tourists flock to see the variety of shrines and temples that reside there and also the second biggest Buddha statue in Japan.</p>
<p>Due to it’s popularity it is mentioned a lot in Japanese media. I think its most famous reference is in the very popular <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0965547/" target="_blank" rel="external">Slam Dunk</a> manga and anime opening where you can see a glimpse of the Enoden at in 0:53 the video I have placed below:</p>

<p>Well that concludes my article on the Enoden, I hope you enjoyed it, keep your eyes peeled for the next photo of the week!</p>

        &lt;p&gt;I personally love spring in Japan. The temperature starts to get warmer, everyone is a lot more lively and the beautiful cherry blossoms begin to appear. Back in the UK, I didn’t really feel excited when spring came, I just knew that I would be getting some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/09/easter-eggs-2016-best-worst-taste-test-chocolate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;chocolate easter eggs&lt;/a&gt; and my brothers would be home from school. In Japan, it feels very different. Mainly because you can see it in the nature with the blooming of the sakura blossoms and other flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

In Japan, it feels very different. Mainly because you can see it in the nature with the blooming of the sakura blossoms and other flowers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>university students getting wasted just before they start their careers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spring officially starts with the national holiday Shunbun no Hi (春分の日) or better known as the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12199262/The-first-day-of-spring.-The-Vernal-Equinox-Everything-you-need-to-know.html" target="_blank" rel="external">March Equinox day</a>. Scientifically speaking, this is the time when the Sun leaves the southern hemisphere and crosses the equator. In other words, in the northern hemisphere starts to get warmer whereas the southern hemisphere starts to get colder. Not only does the weather start to change, but so does the school year. In Japan, the school year starts in the beginning of April. Just before then, it tends to get pretty crowded with the influx of students. Especially in the <a href="http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/1202_izakaya.html" target="_blank" rel="external">izakayas</a>, with all the newly graduated university students getting wasted just before they start their careers.</p>
<img src="/en/Spring-Time-and-Capsules/kugenuma-sakura.jpg" alt="Sakura around the Kugenuma area" title="Sakura around the Kugenuma area">
<img src="/en/Spring-Time-and-Capsules/hanami-tokyo.jpg" alt="Hanami with all my mates outside Tokyo Tower" title="Hanami with all my mates outside Tokyo Tower">
<p>One of the more renowned symbols of Spring in Japan would be sakura (桜) or the <a href="https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/index.php" target="_blank" rel="external">cherry blossom</a>. This flower comes from the class of tree known as the <a href="http://www.flemings.com.au/ornamental_listing.asp?variety=Prunus" target="_blank" rel="external">Prunus</a>. In Japan, when this flower blooms usually light pink flowers appear and it gets very crowded in parks where people are having picnics and drinking under these beautiful trees. These picnics are known as <a href="http://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/cherry-blossoms-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hanami (花見)</a> and has been dated back to the 8th century where it was something just for the elite. In this day and age there are many picnics under the sakura throughout Japan where many Japanese are drinking heavily from morning until evening. The one I went to started at 11 and finished at around 6, so you can imagine how much sake I must have drank.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very similar to sleeping in a coffin with electricity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During spring, for a brief period I had to stay in a <a href="http://kotaku.com/5990496/your-guide-to-japanese-capsule-hotels" target="_blank" rel="external">capsule hotel</a> for a week. Long story short, the lease on my apartment ran out and I was still in the process of looking for a new place. What an interesting experience it was. For those who don’t what a capsule hotel is, it’s simply a hotel with really tiny rooms. My room just contained a bed, television and a couple of sockets. Very similar to sleeping in a coffin with electricity. The reason for the tiny rooms is so that people who stay can save on cost and only concerned about having a place to sleep. Since there are a lot less facilities than a normal hotel room, the cost of staying overnight is quite cheap. I stayed in Shounan Capsule Hotel in Fujisawa for 3800 yen (£24) a night. This was the price of the deluxe capsule room so there are cheaper rooms.</p>
<img src="/en/Spring-Time-and-Capsules/inside-capsule.jpg" alt="Inside the capsule I was staying in" title="Inside the capsule I was staying in">
<img src="/en/Spring-Time-and-Capsules/outside-capsule.jpg" alt="Outside the deluxe capsules" title="Outside the deluxe capsules">
<p>For the toilet and bathroom, those are all shared and although it was clean but it did have the odour of men throughout the hotel. I think what was really interesting was the people it stayed there. They were all Japanese middle aged or senior men. It seemed like some of them were going to work right after there woke up and I never really saw anyone who was a tourist which made me think most people were either staying there because they were homeless at the time like me. Would I stay in one again? Probably no. I don’t mind cheap accommodation but there is something a bit off about sleeping in a box like that.</p>
<p>I hope everyone is enjoying Spring. Next time I want to talk about the process of renting a place in Japan. Thank you for reading!</p>

        &lt;p&gt;Recently I ended up buying a DSLR camera to capture more moments while I’m out especially since I am back in Japan and also for the sake of the blog. I really want to show people what I see but right now I’m an amateur at photography so it will take time for me to express what I want to show to the readers. So I decided to start this series of posts where I can try and improve my photography and give you a brief weekly update of what I have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I ended up buying a DSLR camera to capture more moments while I’m out especially since I am back in Japan and also for the sake of the blog. I really want to show people what I see but right now I’m an amateur at photography so it will take time for me to express what I want to show to the readers. So I decided to start this series of posts where I can try and improve my photography and give you a brief weekly update of what I have been doing.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To begin, here is my first photo (don’t laugh at my amateurism too hard):</p>
<img src="/en/Photo-of-the-Week-1-Kugenuma/shownan-kaigan-park.jpg" alt="The beach nearby my place in Kugenuma" title="The beach nearby my place in Kugenuma">
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I moved back to Japan last week and now I’m temporarily staying in a place called <a href="http://www.surfinginjapan.com/kanagawa/kugenuma" target="_blank" rel="external">Kugenuma</a>. This is located about an hour away from Tokyo in the neighbouring prefecture called <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1215.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Kanagawa</a>.  It is an extremely residential area where there is nothing but houses. After adventuring for about 30 minutes around the area I found a beach called <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021277-d1997895-Reviews-Shonan_Kaigan_Park-Fujisawa_Kanagawa_Prefecture_Kanto.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Shounan Kaigan Park</a>. Even though it was quite chilly there were lot’s of people at the beach mainly surfing and some doing volleyball and all sorts of sports. Around the beach are a few cafes and in the background in the picture you can see the famous Enoshima Island which garners lots of tourists every year.</p>
<p>There is a lot more for me to explore around here but if there is anything people would like me to check out and write a post about, please do let me know. I would be happy to do so. Thanks for reading!</p>

        &lt;p&gt;It has been a few weeks since my return back to the UK from Japan. I had come back about 9 months ago for about 10 days but because I was doing a lot of sight seeing and felt like a tourist, I really didn’t feel like I was truly back. Now that I am back living and working in London I’ve come across the phenomenon of reverse culture shock.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a few weeks since my return back to the UK from Japan. I had come back about 9 months ago for about 10 days but because I was doing a lot of sight seeing and felt like a tourist, I really didn’t feel like I was truly back. Now that I am back living and working in London I’ve come across the phenomenon of reverse culture shock.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Firstly though, what is <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/culture-shock" target="_blank" rel="external">culture shock</a>? In the Oxford Dictionary, culture shock can be defined as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feeling of disorientation experienced by someone when they are suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar culture, way of life, or set of attitudes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think some of us may have experienced this before when you have traveled to a foreign country and encounter or see things that are considered unfamiliar in the country you have spent the majority of your life in. Of course I had experienced culture shock when I moved to Japan. Even though I have grown quite accustomed to their cultures and attitudes, Japan still feels somewhat of a new world to me. Reverse culture shock is the opposite of that. Since I have been living in Japan for a number of years, culture in the UK  has become a bit unfamiliar to the point where I felt anxious at certain times. So here were some of the UK’s norms I had to get used to again.</p>
<h2 id="Ethnic-Diversity"><a href="#Ethnic-Diversity" class="headerlink" title="Ethnic Diversity"></a>Ethnic Diversity</h2><p>One of the things that shocked me when I first went to Japan was the lack of cultural diversity. It seems odd to say this but I was surprised to see nothing but Japanese people in Japan. London is considered one of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/21/britishidentity1" target="_blank" rel="external">most diverse cities in the world</a>. For example, in 2011 only 44.1% of people in London are White British, 37% of the population were born outside the UK and over 300 languages are spoken in London. In Japan in 2011, 98.5% of the population is Japanese making it a very homogeneous culture. In Tokyo you do tend to see non-Japanese people but they seem to be mainly tourists but It is somewhat rare meet a lot of non-Japanese people who live and work in Japan. Although, after time I had gotten used to the homogeneous nature of Japan but after returning back to the UK, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of different races I could see. Not even just seeing all the different races but hearing all the different languages. I went into to Uniqlo to buy a jumper but I heard Korean, Mandarin (or Cantonese, I can’t tell!) and even the woman at the register accidentally spoke to me in Italian!</p>
<img src="/en/Reverse-Culture-Shock/Flags-from-different-nations.jpg" alt="This was an exhibit to celebrate London's diversity and the 2012 Olympics" title="This was an exhibit to celebrate London's diversity and the 2012 Olympics">
<h2 id="Crossing-Roads"><a href="#Crossing-Roads" class="headerlink" title="Crossing Roads"></a>Crossing Roads</h2><p>Another behaviour that I had realised I had lost was the fact that I could not cross roads properly anymore. It does sound strange but in Japan they have the jaywalking law just like America. I do remember when I had started living in Japan I did not know the law about this at all and always wondered why are people waiting at the lights when there are no cars whatsoever. “Just cross!”, I always thought to myself, so in typical British fashion I crossed the roads when there was a green light and got stared at. For any Japanese or American readers, there is no law such as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26073797" target="_blank" rel="external">Jaywalking</a> in the UK which means British people can cross wherever they like and not be penalised. From what I understand, Jaywalking was a term that first made an appearance in the 1910s. Jay means an inexperienced person and walk of course means to walk. This term was used by the motorway industry in the 1920s to keep pedestrians off the street. It wasn’t taken seriously at first and then in the 1930s it became the norm. Just like America, Japan take jaywalking seriously. I have been stopped by the police because I have been jaywalking. After coming back to the UK, I honestly had forgotten how people recklessly cross the roads here to the point I was so reluctant to do so and waited for the lights to change. Not just that but even cars and buses gave a lot of leeway to pedestrians who were crossing the roads wherever they please.  Often so those pedestrians usually thanked drivers who had stopped for them with a gesture of waving. This never happens in Japan, but after a few weeks I was back to Jaywalking in London.</p>
<img src="/en/Reverse-Culture-Shock/Jaywalking.jpg" alt="Typical jaywalking that can be seen everyday in London" title="Typical jaywalking that can be seen everyday in London">
<h2 id="Behaviour-in-Trains"><a href="#Behaviour-in-Trains" class="headerlink" title="Behaviour in Trains"></a>Behaviour in Trains</h2><p>One of the biggest changes I have noticed after living in Tokyo for two years is the train system. I believe many people have the image of the trains in Tokyo during rush hours being extremely crowded. Yes you’re very correct! I think the worst line to ride on the tube in London (We call the subway the tube in London for your information) is the Central Line or the Northern Line. For the commuting Londoners out there, imagine 20 times that. That is rush hour in Tokyo on pretty much every line. Every morning whilst I was going to work in Tokyo, I’ve been crushed by other commuters so everyone can get to work on time. In the beginning, this was one of the most frustrating things about living in Tokyo. I really hated it to the point I wanted to argue with people who were pushing me. The amount of pushing that happens in Tokyo never happens in London. People who live in London seem to be very wary of their space when travelling on transportation. A lot of people will not even move up even if there is some kind of space just to avoid being in a crowded space. In Tokyo it is the opposite, I wouldn’t say Japanese people like being in crowded space but they are patient enough it to deal with it just to let more people in and also to avoid being late as much as possible. Commuters aren’t the only that push sometimes there is staff dedicated to help stuff bags into the carriages when they are blocking the doors. Maybe some readers have seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0A9-oUoMug" target="_blank" rel="external">famous videos of commuters getting pushed by staff into trains</a>. This I have never experienced at all whilst I have been there and I’m not too sure if they still exist. When I started to use the tube here, it was frustrating that I couldn’t get on the train sometimes. I wanted to push my way on which would be the norm in Tokyo but in no way is that acceptable in London.</p>

<img src="/en/Reverse-Culture-Shock/Commute-in-Tokyo.jpg" alt="Commuting in Tokyo" title="Commuting in Tokyo">
<p>Hopefully you could see some of my predicaments after returning to my life back here in the UK. It’s interesting how you adjust when you are in an environment you are not used to Although once you are used that foreign environment, it’s not so simple to adjust back to what you have been accustomed to your whole life. I hope you enjoyed this post!</p>

        &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! Long time no see! Hope everyone has been well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has definitely been a while since I have written any sort of blog post. First of all I would like to say sorry for not being able to continue with my blog about how my life was going on in Japan. When I had stopped writing blog posts I received quite a few messages asking me, “Where the heck have your posts gone?”. So I decided to bring the blog back and properly inform you of not only what I am doing in Japan, but also an insight into what Japanese culture truly is. Before that though, let me give you an update of what I have been doing for the past year and a bit.&lt;br&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! Long time no see! Hope everyone has been well!</p>
<p>It has definitely been a while since I have written any sort of blog post. First of all I would like to say sorry for not being able to continue with my blog about how my life was going on in Japan. When I had stopped writing blog posts I received quite a few messages asking me, “Where the heck have your posts gone?”. So I decided to bring the blog back and properly inform you of not only what I am doing in Japan, but also an insight into what Japanese culture truly is. Before that though, let me give you an update of what I have been doing for the past year and a bit.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>The last thing I posted was about my trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido" target="_blank" rel="external">Hokkaido</a> with the Yoshino family. It has been more than a whole year since then, so a lot has happened but I’ll summarise it to the major things. One of the big things was having my visa extended, so I shall quickly explain how the whole visa matter works. Since there is a good relationship between the UK and Japan, up to 1000 UK citizens aged between 18 - 30 years old are entitled to a <a href="http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/visa/working-holiday.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Working Holiday Visa</a>. This visa allows you to travel and work in Japan for one year. After it expires you can then apply for various other visas that allow you to stay longer in the country. My time was running out and I had decided I want to stay longer in Japan. Luckily, I had a company sponsor me and I could stay another year due to my new Working Visa.</p>

<p>Another major thing that happened was returning back to the UK for the first time since moving to Tokyo. It had been about 14-15 months since I had eaten a real curry, drank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribena" target="_blank" rel="external">Ribena</a>, eaten <a href="http://www.nandos.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="external">Nandos</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.morleyschicken.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Morleys</a> and the most important being eating my Mother’s <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/jamie-oliver-jollof-rice-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="external">jollof rice</a> (which I received within 30 minutes of entering the house. Best Mom in the world!). It was fantastic to be back, nothing had really changed too much but I realised Tokyo is really different from London. Some things I had missed from London such as going to the pub with your mates on a Friday night then randomly deciding we are going to <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/shoreditch-bars" target="_blank" rel="external">Shoreditch</a>. I had also missed things from Tokyo too, such as feeling hungry at 3am and going to <a href="http://www.matsuyafoods.co.jp/english/menu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Matsuya</a> to buy a delicious beef bowl for 400 yen (Around £2). Returning home after all that time made me realise I missed my family and friends and I really do love the UK but Japan is definitely a second home for me.</p>

<p>After spending about two weeks in the UK, I had realised I have been in Asia for a long time and Japan was the only country I had been to. With that it was decided that Vietnam was due. We decided to go to Vietnam during Silver Week for about 7 days. Oh how short that time was. Vietnam was fantastic! I was a little worried at first because before going I didn’t know much about Vietnam except: what <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24288422" target="_blank" rel="external">Pho</a> is,  the war and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyen" target="_blank" rel="external">Nguyen</a> is a very common Vietnamese name. All in all a very great trip, people are extremely friendly, food is great and there is breathtaking scenery (<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/northeast-vietnam/halong-bay" target="_blank" rel="external">Halong Bay</a>, I’m looking at you!). A lot of time was spent in the capital city <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/hanoi" target="_blank" rel="external">Hanoi</a> but also visited <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g298082-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province-Vacations.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Hoian</a> for a bit. My only regret is not staying in Hoian longer. I recommend checking out Hoian in September, it is paradise!</p>

<p>I think the final major thing was that I have met and reunited with so many people during my time in Japan. The amount of interesting and friendly people there can be overwhelming. I can learn so much by just going to <a href="http://www.unmissabletokyo.com/golden-gai" target="_blank" rel="external">Golden Gai</a> for a night out and talking to so many different people. I think the main factor of this is that of course Japan is not the country I was born neither grew up in so it is always just fascinating for me to conversate with Japanese people. Also a lot of people have visited me whilst I have been living in Japan and I’m so grateful for that. Sometimes it is not so easy being an expat especially when your mother tongue is completely different from that country. Even most of the people who can speak English speak American English so sometimes I was misunderstood!</p>

<p>I hope that gives you a basic idea of what happened to me. Right now I am back in the UK again for a couple of months and then I will head back to Japan. So for the time being I will write about London for the people back in Japan. There’s still the typical strange image of what the Japanese think of the UK, so hopefully I can clarify it for some in my blog. Thank you for reading once again!</p>
