Hey everyone! Long time no see! げんき？(Genki?)


It has definitely been a while since I have written any sort of blog post. First of all I would like to say sorry for not being able to continue with my blog about how my life is going on in Japan. When I had stopped writing blog posts I received quite a few messages asking me, "Where the heck have your posts gone?". So I decided to bring the blog back and properly inform you of not only what I am doing in Japan, but also an insight into what Japanese culture truly is. Before that though, let me give you an update of what I have been doing for the past year.
<!-- more -->

The last thing I posted was about my trip to [Hokkaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido) with the Yoshino family. It has been more than a whole year since then, so a lot has happened but I'll summarise it to the major things. One of the big things was having my visa extended, so I shall quickly explain how the whole visa matter works. Since there is a good relationship between  the UK and Japan, up to 1000 UK citizens aged between 18 - 30 years old are entitled to a [Working Holiday Visa](http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/visa/working-holiday.html). This visa allows you to travel and work in Japan for one year. After it expires you can then apply for various other visas that allow you to stay longer in the country. My time was running out and I had decided I want to stay longer in Japan. Luckily, I had a company sponsor me and now I can stay another year due to my new Working Visa.

Another major thing that happened was returning back to the UK for the first time since moving to Tokyo. It had been about 14-15 months since I had eaten a real curry, drank [Ribena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribena), eaten [Nandos](http://www.nandos.co.uk/) & [Morleys](http://www.morleyschicken.com/index.html) and the most important being eating my Mother's [jollof rice](http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/jamie-oliver-jollof-rice-recipe/) (which I received within 30 minutes of entering the house. Best Mom in the world!). It was fantastic to be back, nothing had really changed too much but I realised Tokyo is really different from London. Somethings I missed from London such as going to the pub with your mates on a Friday night then deciding are we going to [Shoreditch](http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/shoreditch-bars) or not or from Tokyo such as feeling hungry at 3 am and going to [Matsuya](http://www.matsuyafoods.co.jp/english/menu/) to buy a delicious beef bowl for 400 yen (Around £2). Returning home after all this time made me realise I missed my family and friends and I really do love the UK but Japan is definitely a second home for me.

It was about two weeks I spent in the UK and I realised I have been in Asia for a long time and Japan has been the only country in Asia I have been to. With that it was decided that Vietnam was due. We decided to go to Vietnam during Silver Week for about 7 days. Oh how short that time was. Vietnam was fantastic! I was a little worried at first because I didn't know much about Vietnam except: what [Pho](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24288422) is,  the war and that [Nguyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyen) is a very common Vietnamese name. All in all a very great trip, people are extremely friendly, food is great and breathtaking scenery ([Halong Bay](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/northeast-vietnam/halong-bay), I'm looking at you!). We spent most of our time in the capital city [Hanoi](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/hanoi) but when [Hoian](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g298082-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province-Vacations.html) for a bit. My only regret is not staying in Hoian longer. I recommend checking out Hoian in September, it is paradise!

I think the final major thing was that I have met and reunited with so many people this year. In Japan, the amount of interesting and friendly people here can be overwhelming. I can learn so much by just going to [Golden Gai](http://www.unmissabletokyo.com/golden-gai) for a night out and talking to so many different people. I think the main factor of this is that of course Japan is not the country I was born neither grew up in so it is always just fascinating for me to hear what other Japanese people opinions are. Also a lot of people have visited me whilst I have been living in Japan and I'm so grateful. Sometimes it is not so easy being an expat especially when your mother tongue is completely different from that country and every other person who does speak English speaks American English (no offence!). It feels good to reminisce and speak comfortably and still be understood. Things like this I really miss!

I hope that gives you a basic idea of what happened to me. Obviously a lot more than that has happened but I can't possibly cover all of it. As time goes on, I will trickle the information through in my future posts. Thank you for reading once again!
