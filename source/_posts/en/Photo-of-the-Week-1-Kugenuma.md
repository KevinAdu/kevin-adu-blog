Recently I ended up buying a DSLR camera to capture more moments while I’m out especially since I am back in Japan and also for the sake of the blog. I really want to show people what I see but right now I’m an amateur at photography so it will take time for me to express what I want to show to the readers. So I decided to start this series of posts where I can try and improve my photography and give you a brief weekly update of what I have been doing.

To begin, here is my first photo (don’t laugh at my amateurism too hard):

As I mentioned earlier, I moved back to Japan last week and now I’m temporarily staying in a place called [Kugenuma](http://www.surfinginjapan.com/kanagawa/kugenuma). This is located about an hour away from Tokyo in the neighbouring prefecture called [Kanagawa](http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1215.html).  It is an extremely residential area where there is nothing but houses. After adventuring for about 30 minutes around the area I found a beach called [Shounan Kalgan Park](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021277-d1997895-Reviews-Shonan_Kaigan_Park-Fujisawa_Kanagawa_Prefecture_Kanto.html). Even though it was quite chilly there were lot’s of people at the beach mainly surfing and some doing volleyball and all sorts of sports. Around the beach are a few cafes and in the background in the picture you can see the famous Enoshima Island which garners lots of tourists every year.

There is a lot more for me to explore around here but if there is anything people would like me to check out and write a post about, please do let me know. I would be happy to do so. Thanks for reading!
