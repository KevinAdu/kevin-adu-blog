At the end of 2017, I took the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) exam for the grade N2 for the third time. N2 is the second hardest level you can take for the JLPT, it can be equated to intermediate or upper intermediate level. A few days ago, I received the results for my third attempt and to my surprise not only did I pass, I managed to obtain a perfect score in listening. I had been slacking a lot in my Japanese studies for a while hence why I failed twice before so I wanted to go back the regime which helped me improve my Japanese quite quickly in the beginning. Since a few people have asked how do I study Japanese, I thought I would list the different resource and techniques I have been using so far.

### Anki

Anki is where I do the bulk of my studying. Anki is a wonderful application that allows you to memorise things quickly. It's simply a flashcard application which incorporates SRS (Space Repetition System). The way I use it is to review anything new that I have come across in my studies. Whether it's a grammar point I learnt from a textbook or an unknown word I picked up from a Japanese drama,  it all gets added to Anki so I can memorise it sometime in the future. I usually use Anki when I'm on the train to and from work as my commute gives me ample time to go through as many flashcards as possible.

### Dramas/Anime

Watching anime or dramas helps with your listening and helps you to understand Japanese culture much better. I think when learning a language understanding the culture is key to having natural conversation to a culture you aren't yet accustomed to. Simply learning the words and trying to translate from English to Japanese in your head and say what you’ve translated will seem very unnatural. From dramas and anime, not only can you learn about culture but you will pick many interesting expressions used throughout daily life. For studying purposes, I watch with Japanese subtitles only. With English subtitles, I tend to be concentrating on just reading the English subtitles rather than focusing on what the characters are saying. With Japanese subtitles, whilst you read it, you can confirm what you have read while listening to the dialogue. Also if you couldn’t catch what someone said, you can rewind and check with the Japanese subtitles.

### Manga/Novels

Reading will help you strengthen your vocabulary and grammar knowledge. I think it’s important to read both manga and novels. In Japanese, there is a massive difference between written and spoken language. The difference between manga and novels distinctly highlight it and it is very useful to know this especially if you’re going for the JLPT qualifications.

### JLPT Textbooks

Whilst I have been studying Japanese, I have been taking the JLPT to give myself an aim so I can continue improving. I have bought textbooks to help study for the exams. Not only are these useful for passing exams, I personally feel they help fill the blanks with discovering common words you may have not come across yet in your studies. The grammar points that you need to know for the JLPT are split between written and spoken Japanese.

### Tae Kim’s Grammar guide

In the beginning I was trying to decide, how should I learn grammar. I think grammar is the most important aspect of a language. In order for you to sound coherent while you are speaking or writing, you need to have a good grasp on the grammar of the language. There's a lot of debate over which Japanese grammar book you should use when you start learning Japanese. I personally use Tae Kim's Grammar Guide. A lot of people don't like it because of its lack of practical questions to reinforce what you have learnt and that it also starts with non-polite Japanese. I mainly like it because it gets straight to the point. I add the example sentences into Anki and if I need further examples I find it from another source such as a novel or manga.

### Wanikani

Kanji is the biggest bane for anybody with no experience reading Chinese characters. Kanji are the Chinese characters used in the Japanese language and there are 2000 commonly known kanji. I have tried many methods to learn kanji from continuously writing the character down until I remember to Heisig’s Remember the Kanji method. WaniKani is an application created by the people who own the Japanese blog Tofugu. Kanji is presented in groups which contain similar patterns making it much easier to learn and more importantly remember. It also provides mnemonics  and present them to you in the best order for learning kanji. Unfortunately it’s not a free application but they do give a trial. I really recommend trying it out.

### Bunpro

The list may seem a bit overwhelming but as with anything I assure you if you continue to practice everyday, not only will you improve but you will notice your improvements and that will keep the motivation going. If anyone has any other methods of learning a second language, please do let me know. I’m curious to try all methods. Thank you for reading.
